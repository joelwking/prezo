DevNet Create 2021 Abstract

### Title:

Do you have any slides …….?

### Abstract:

I have over a thousand Powerpoint files on my laptop’s hard drive.  Add to that the mess of presentations scattered on chatrooms with no single source of truth. This presentation explores how to store and manage presentations held as objects in the cloud.
 
The session examines using the MinIO Python SDK to upload and query presentations in Amazon S3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service), the object storage service of AWS.  

The Python library python-pptx extracts text and tags from each presentation. The rake-nltk (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction algorithm) analyzes keywords from PowerPoint files providing metadata to these objects stored in S3.

After the objects are loaded to a bucket, the MinIO Python SDK queries the metadata of all the objects, and the FuzzyWuzzy Python library enables string matching. Share the presentation requested with your co-workers using a download URL.

Practical communications skills are essential for leading and developing teams. Be efficient in indexing and sharing your ideas with others.
